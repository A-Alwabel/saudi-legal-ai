## 🐛 **KNOWN LIMITATIONS**

These are mock/demo limitations, not bugs:
1. Data resets when server restarts (in-memory only)
2. File upload shows UI but doesn't store files
3. Reports show sample data, not real calculations
4. Search/filter works on current page data only
5. Email/SMS notifications don't actually send
6. Print/Export creates sample files only

---

## 🎯 **NEXT STEPS FOR PRODUCTION**

If you want to make this production-ready:
1. Connect real MongoDB database
2. Implement proper JWT with refresh tokens
3. Add real file storage (S3/local)
4. Implement real email service
5. Add data validation and sanitization
6. Implement real business logic
7. Add automated testing
8. Set up CI/CD pipeline
9. Configure production hosting
10. Add monitoring and logging

---

## 💡 **QUICK TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **"Site can't be reached"**
- Make sure both servers are running
- Check ports 3005 and 5000 are free
- Try http://127.0.0.1:3005 instead

### **"Network Error" on login**
- Mock backend not running
- Start server: `cd server && node mock-server.js`

### **Pages show no data**
- API calls failing
- Check browser console for errors
- Restart both servers

### **Can't create/edit items**
- Feature uses mock data
- Check if API endpoint exists
- Some features have UI only
