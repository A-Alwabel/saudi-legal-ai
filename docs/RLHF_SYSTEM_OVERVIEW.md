## 🔄 **HOW RLHF WORKS IN YOUR SYSTEM**

### **Step 1: Lawyer Uses System (Normal Flow)**
```typescript
// User asks question through existing UI
POST /api/v1/ai/consultation
{
  "question": "ساعات العمل الإضافية",
  "caseType": "labor", 
  "language": "ar"
}

// System checks for improved answers first, then provides response
Response: {
  "id": "consultation-uuid",
  "answer": "Improved answer if available, or original",
  "verificationLevel": "lawyer_verified" | "unverified",
  "canProvideFeedback": true
}
```

### **Step 2: Lawyer Provides Feedback (New Feature)**
```typescript
// Lawyer clicks thumbs down on answer
POST /api/v1/ai/feedback
{
  "consultationId": "consultation-uuid",
  "userId": "lawyer-user-id",       // From your existing User model
  "lawFirmId": "law-firm-id",       // From your existing LawFirm model
  "rating": 2,
  "feedbackType": "inaccurate",
  "improvementSuggestion": "The legal reference is wrong..."
}

// Feedback stored in new LawyerFeedback collection
// Links to your existing User and LawFirm models
```

### **Step 3: YOU Review Feedback (Admin Panel)**
```typescript
// You check pending feedback
GET /api/v1/admin/feedback/pending

// You decide what to do with each feedback
POST /api/v1/admin/feedback/:id/review
{
  "adminDecision": "needs_lawyer_verification",
  "adminNotes": "Complex legal issue, send to hired lawyer"
}
```

### **Step 4: Answer Improvement (You or Hired Lawyer)**
```typescript
// You or hired lawyer provides correct answer
POST /api/v1/admin/feedback/:id/improve
{
  "improvedAnswer": "Corrected legal response...",
  "legalReferences": ["Verified law articles"],
  "verificationLevel": "lawyer_verified",
  "verifiedBy": "hired-lawyer-user-id"
}

// System learns and uses improved answer for similar questions
```

### **Step 5: System Learning (Automatic)**
```typescript
// Next time someone asks similar question:
// System automatically finds and uses the improved answer
// Tracks usage statistics
// Gets better with every improvement
```
