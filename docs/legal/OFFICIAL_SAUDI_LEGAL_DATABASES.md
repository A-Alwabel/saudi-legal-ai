## ❌ **WHAT DOESN'T EXIST (YET)**

```
MISSING:
❌ Searchable database of all Saudi laws

```
WHAT'S NOT AVAILABLE:
❌ Government API for legal data
❌ Automated legal update feeds
❌ Machine-readable legal content
❌ Real-time law change notifications
❌ Programmatic access to legal documents

IMPACT: Cannot build automated legal update system
without manual monitoring and verification
```

## 📋 **OFFICIAL GAZETTE (أم القرى) STATUS**

### **Official Gazette Reality Check:**
```
🏛️ WHAT IT IS:
   - Official publication for royal decrees
   - Primary source for new laws
   - Published by government printing press

📍 ACCESS REALITY:
   ❌ No comprehensive online database
   ❌ Limited digital archive access
   ❌ No searchable online interface
   ❌ Physical/PDF distribution primarily
