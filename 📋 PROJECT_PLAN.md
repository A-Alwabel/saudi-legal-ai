## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

### **Potential Risks:**

1. **More Issues Than Expected**
   - Risk: Phase 1 reveals major problems
   - Mitigation: Have realistic and pessimistic timelines
   - Action: Prioritize ruthlessly

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Risk: Critical packages not installed
   - Mitigation: Check package.json early
   - Action: Install all dependencies first

3. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Risk: MongoDB not connecting
   - Mitigation: Test connection early
   - Action: Fix connection before other work

4. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
   - Risk: 400+ errors as documented
   - Mitigation: Use JavaScript fallbacks
   - Action: Fix gradually, not all at once

5. **Scope Creep**
   - Risk: Adding features before fixing broken ones
   - Mitigation: Strict priority enforcement
   - Action: Only work on critical issues first
